	abstract = {In Information-Centric Networking (ICN), in-network caching is one of the core functions to implement efficient content distribution. As content is served from the network cache, redundant transmission across the same link is reduced and better quality services are provided to the user. However, caching operations (locating cached content, validating/writing content to the cache) may be a large burden on routers. In this article, we substantially reduce the caching overhead of routers by introducing T-Caching, a new in-network caching model in which routers selectively cache some of the most popular content recommended by content providers. In T-Caching, tokens are used 1) to enable routers to maximize caching benefits by simply controlling the amount of content inserted into the cache; 2) to allow content providers to recommend the most popular content as much as routers would actually cache. Our simulation and empirical studies using synthetic data, as well as real-world traces, show that T-Caching allows routers to insert much less than 1 percent of the content into the cache, compared to typical caching mechanisms. Nevertheless, the cache-hit ratio is improved by up to 2~9 times depending on the cache size. We believe that T-Caching can significantly contribute to improving feasibility and performance of in-network caching in ICN.},

	abstract = {Delay sensitive applications are being actively introduced with the advent of 5G and vehicular communications, and such applications are very sensitive to tail latency. However, tail latency has
		not been seriously considered so far, especially in IEEE 802.11–based networks. Channel access is scheduled by random Contention Window (CW) values in IEEE 802.11–based networks, and the node with the larger CW waits longer, and it may even observe multiple transmissions from a single contending node, which results in a long latency tail. In this paper, we propose a new decentralized MAC called SynchMAC to mitigate this latency tail. In SynchMAC, every competing node transmits exactly one packet within a virtual time slot without a centralized controller. Using the proposed approach, the maximum channel access latency is bounded by T×2N, where T is the time required for transmitting a single packet (including Inter-Frame Space and CW) and N is the number of competing nodes. To maximize the system throughput, the proposed scheme optimizes the value of T by considering the probability of successful transmission. Our simulation study shows that SynchMAC reduces the maximum access latency by up to 94\% and 53\% compared with the conventional IEEE 802.11 MAC and the comparative scheme, respectively, without degrading throughput performance. We also show that SynchMAC is easily extended to support weighted access.},

According to our analyses, communication range could be broadened if an image is proactively manipulated before being displayed according to the locations of both a screen and a camera. By implementing a simple application, we prove that the proposed scheme outperforms the existing ones in terms of throughput, reliability and coverage.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
