	abstract = {Recently, machine learning-based automated program synthesis and repair have extensively been investigated for various domain-specific and general-purpose programming languages. In this paper, we revisit the problem of synthesizing programs from input-output examples, and reformulate it as a problem of program repair. More specifically, we propose an automated program repair framework, called RepCoder, that can be used with a neural program synthesis method such as DeepCoder and PCCoder. Given a set of input-output examples and a user program with some errors, RepCoder effectively reduces the search space by considering user-written statements to be correct with high likelihood if they are included in the top-k candidate statements predicted by the employed neural synthesis method. Otherwise, they are considered to be incorrect and replaced with the candidate statements with the highest probabilities that are consistent with the given input-output examples. Our experimental studies confirm that RepCoder using PCCoder as the main predictor effectively and efficiently repairs erroneous programs, showing that it achieves up to 3&times; the error correction rate compared to when using only PCCoder for repair, i.e., synthesizing a program from scratch without considering the given user program.},

	abstract = {Energy-harvesting is being actively researched for the Machine-to-Machine networks. Without replacement of battery, energy-harvesting enables nodes (or machines) to perform their work permanently by recharging energy store periodically from an external source. After performing given tasks, in many applications, each energy-harvesting node transmits data to the gateway node. Here, the difference in harvested/consumed energy could lead to sub-optimal communication due to depletion of energy. In this paper, we design an energy-aware medium access control scheme for energy-harvesting machine-to-machine networks. The proposed algorithm controls delivery error rate due to energy depletion through limited contention among energy-exhausting nodes, and maximize slot efficiency to minimize overall communication duration. Maximizing slot efficiency is implemented in two ways: utility-based and learning-based. Simulation studies have shown that the proposed schemes effectively minimize delivery error rate and communication period, outperforming the existing strategies in the literature.},

Especially, if poisoned contents lie in the network cache, called content store(CS), interests would be served by the poisoned content rather than they propagate toward the content server. Consequently, users whose interests pass through the contaminated CS cannot access the valid content. In order to resolve the problem, every content is verified before they are inserted into the CS. However, this built-in verification mechanism is not practically feasible due to its huge computational overhead. In this paper, we address problems of content integrity in NDN in details, including how to violate content integrity.

	abstract = {In Information-Centric Networking (ICN), in-network caching is one of the core functions to implement efficient content distribution. As content is served from the network cache, redundant transmission across the same link is reduced and better quality services are provided to the user. However, caching operations (locating cached content, validating/writing content to the cache) may be a large burden on routers. In this article, we substantially reduce the caching overhead of routers by introducing T-Caching, a new in-network caching model in which routers selectively cache some of the most popular content recommended by content providers. In T-Caching, tokens are used 1) to enable routers to maximize caching benefits by simply controlling the amount of content inserted into the cache; 2) to allow content providers to recommend the most popular content as much as routers would actually cache. Our simulation and empirical studies using synthetic data, as well as real-world traces, show that T-Caching allows routers to insert much less than 1 percent of the content into the cache, compared to typical caching mechanisms. Nevertheless, the cache-hit ratio is improved by up to 2\~9 times depending on the cache size. We believe that T-Caching can significantly contribute to improving feasibility and performance of in-network caching in ICN.},

		not been seriously considered so far, especially in IEEE 802.11–based networks. Channel access is scheduled by random Contention Window (CW) values in IEEE 802.11–based networks, and the node with the larger CW waits longer, and it may even observe multiple transmissions from a single contending node, which results in a long latency tail. In this paper, we propose a new decentralized MAC called SynchMAC to mitigate this latency tail. In SynchMAC, every competing node transmits exactly one packet within a virtual time slot without a centralized controller. Using the proposed approach, the maximum channel access latency is bounded by T×2N, where T is the time required for transmitting a single packet (including Inter-Frame Space and CW) and N is the number of competing nodes. To maximize the system throughput, the proposed scheme optimizes the value of T by considering the probability of successful transmission. Our simulation study shows that SynchMAC reduces the maximum access latency by up to 94\% and 53\% compared with the conventional IEEE 802.11 MAC and the comparative scheme, respectively, without degrading throughput performance. We also show that SynchMAC is easily extended to support weighted access.},

In our preliminary work, we have suggested a content verification scheme that minimizes unnecessary verification and favors already verified content in the content store, which reduces the verification overhead by as much as 90\% without failing to detect every piece of poisoned content. Under this scheme, however, routers are vulnerable to verification attack, in which a large amount of unverified content is accessed to exhaust system resources. In this paper, we carefully look at the possible concerns of our preliminary work, including verification attack, and present a simple but effective solution.

For that, NDN routers perform named-based routing, packet-level caching, and cache look-up, but these operations impose huge overhead on routers. To solve the feasibility issue of NDN router, in this paper, we propose an alternative architecture where caching and routing are separated. Routers are dedicated to packet routing while the cache server that is installed at every domain takes charge of in-network caching. Requests that have visited the cache server are marked and forwarded without further cache-lookup within the domain. This approach fundamentally relieves routers of heavy burden. Additionally, it introduces following benefits: (1) Huge amount of resource for caching is saved; (2) The effectiveness of in-network caching is improved; (3) The access delay of time-sensitive traffic is minimized. For the proposed architecture, cache look-up is performed via reserved links between the cache server and routers. Therefore, it is important to locate the cache server from the point of installation cost. We address how to place the cache server with the minimum cost, which is proved NP-complete, and present an approximation algorithm. Our simulation study shows that the proposed scheme reduces caching operations by up to 80\% while achieving the same caching benefit only with 40\% caching space.},

In this paper, we raise questions about this research direction by analysing the performance of reliability and energy efficiency of both broadcast and unicast delivery schemes. Our analysis shows that unicast delivery outperforms broadcast delivery, unless topological changes incur too much packet flooding overhead. Based on this observation, we present a novel energy efficient content distribution scheme that delivers the content in a unicast manner while minimizing flooding overhead by taking advantage of ICN features. Via ns-3 simulation, we compare the performance of the proposed scheme with that of other comparative schemes, and show that the proposed scheme achieves much higher reliability and energy efficiency in content distribution under mobile ad-hoc network environments.},

However, in a real environment, the assumption cannot be hold: the density of nodes constantly changes and a network can be separated due to node mobility even when it is composed of large number of nodes. We propose a routing scheme for maximizing the delivery rate in a network with varying density. In the proposed scheme, data packets are used to search an available path while they are delivered by DTN-based routing. If a path exists, subsequent packets are relayed along the path. Otherwise, packets are delivered continuously using DTN-based routing.

To overcome these issues, much recent research has been carried out. However, while the results have helped achieve smooth communication between nodes, there are still certain shortcomings. For example, if many messages are input by the nodes in a network, these schemes do not work well. To resolve this problem, we propose a novel sending rate control algorithm in an additive increase/multiplicative decrease manner. To detect network congestion, we measure the receiving rate, one-way delay, and average number of copies. When the measured receiving rate increases, the congestion window (cwnd) also increases; otherwise, cwnd decreases. The simulations show that the proposed algorithm can adjust the sending rate of nodes to avoid network congestion and provide a fair share of the network for the nodes.},

The characteristics of blockchain such as immutability and openness, however, have made DApps more vulnerable to various security risks, and thus it has become of great significance to validate the integrity of DApps before they actually operate upon blockchain. Recently, research on vulnerability in smart contracts (a building block of DApps) has been actively conducted, and various vulnerabilities and their countermeasures were reported. However, the effectiveness of such countermeasures has not been studied well, and no appropriate methods have been proposed to evaluate them. In this paper, we propose a software tool that can easily perform comparative studies by adding existing/new countermeasures and labeled smart contract codes. The proposed tool demonstrates verification performance using various statistical indicators, which helps to identify the most effective countermeasures for each type of vulnerability. Using the proposed tool, we evaluated state-of-the-art countermeasures with 237 labeled benchmark codes. The results indicate that for certain types of vulnerabilities, some countermeasures show evenly good performance scores on various metrics. However, it is also observed that countermeasures that detect the largest number of vulnerable codes typically generate much more false positives, resulting in very low precision and accuracy. Consequently, under given constraints, different countermeasures may be recommended for detecting vulnerabilities of interest. We believe that the proposed tool could effectively be utilized for a future verification study of smart contract applications and contribute to the development of practical and secure smart contract applications.},

In ICN, named content is distributed over the network cache and it is accessed by name instead of a location identifier. These aspects allow users to retrieve content from any of the nodes having replicas, and consequently 1) network resources are more efficiently utilized by avoiding redundant transmission and 2) more scalable services are provided by distributing server loads. However, in-network caching in ICN brings about a new type of security issues, called content poisoning attacks, where fabricated content is located in the network cache and interferes with the normal behavior of the system. In this paper, we look into the problems of content poisoning in ICN and discuss security architectures against them. In particular, we reconsider the state-of-the-art schemes from the perspective of feasibility, and propose a practical security architecture.},

	abstract = {With the advent of self-driving cars, vehicular networking is gaining greater attention and the subject of extensive research. It is important to implement a more efficient and secure transportation system by enabling communication among objects on the road. Specifically, safety applications should be delivered in a reliable manner within a limited time period. Several time division multiple access (TDMA) protocols have been proposed to realize this. However, most of the existing research have proposed slot management approaches by taking into account the static topology; they have not sufficiently discussed research on “merging collision” arising from overlapping two or more collision domains due to vehicle mobility. In this study, we examine the effect of merging collision in terms of packet delivery ratio, overhead, and inter-basic safety message (inter-BSM) delay. Delay between BSMs received in succession. To mitigate the effect of merging collision, we also propose a lightweight distributed TDMA protocol, where the order of vehicles on the road and their relative distances are exploited to determine the dedicated slot. The collision is further resolved using in-band signaling from the surrounding vehicles. Simulation studies show that the proposed scheme improves the performance of the packet delivery ratio (PDR) 10\% more than the comparative protocol, and consequently achieves 97\% and 95\% PDRs, in highway and urban environment, respectively. Furthermore, the overhead and inter-BSM delay are substantially reduced.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
